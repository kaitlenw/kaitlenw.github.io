            Monopoly was a project I implemented in Java, over the course of two years. In its final form, it had two main applications--the game itself, and a separate application for creating custom boards. Both applications were implemented using Java (with Java
            Swing for the UI) and SQLite for saving the state of games and boards.
        </p>
        <p>
            For both the main game and the board editor, the board graphic was procedurally generated using a Canvas widget from Java Swing in order to allow for the names and colours of the squares to be easily changed, regardless of which was board was being used.
            In addition, in the main game, this allowed for the players' locations and any houses and/or hotels to be drawn dynamically where needed.
        </p>

        <h2>Monopoly</h2>
        <p>
            At its heart, the game application implements all of the rules that define Monopoly. This includes going to Jail and getting back out, building houses and hotels, mortgaging properties and trading properties, money and Get Out Of Jail Free cards with
            another player. There was much focus on the GUI to make player interactions easy and intuitive; some imagination and creativity was needed for this, as Java Swing was not designed for making games in! An example of this is using a dialog box
            with formatted text as a Property Deed.
        </p>
        <p>
            During a player's turn, the main screen will display information they may find useful, such as which properties they already own, and how much money they still have. In addition, a log is kept of events that have taken place since the current player started
            their turn; this is particularly useful if the game is saved and quit partway through a player's turn, as the log can aid with picking up where the players left off.
        </p>
        <p>
            While a game is being played, two database files are used, for two different purposes:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Board Database: provides information, such as names and property groups, about the board being played on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Specific Game Database: provides information, such as player names and owned properties, about the game currently in progress.
                </li>
            </ul>
            In addition, the application uses a third file to keep track of the saved games, such as which board they are being played on, and the different boards that can be played on, such as what tax system they use.
        </p>

        <h2>Board Editor</h2>
        <p>
            The board editor allows users to create their own boards that can be imported into the main Monopoly application and played on. Users can decide a name for their board (such as a location it's based off), a currency, what colour scheme they want to use
            and which tax system they want to use on the Income Tax square--a flat rate of 200, or the smaller of 10% of the player's balance or 200. All property squares (including Stations and Utilities) can have their names customised by the user,
            and these are then used in randomly generated Chance and Community Chest cards.
        </p>

            Below you will find some screenshots of the project. This project is not currently being worked on so these are not expected to change.
