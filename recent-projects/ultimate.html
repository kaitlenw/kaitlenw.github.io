            An implementation of the extended version of the well-known Tic Tac Toe.</p>
        <p>
            In this version, you play to win three <em>boards</em> in a row instead, made more difficult by the fact that your opponent's last move dictates your next move! In addition to building the functionality to validate moves and determine when
            the game has been finished (in any capacity), this implementation also features an AI player, produced by using Monte Carlo Tree Search.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is written in Python 3, and makes use of the PyQt library for the GUI. The code can be seen <a href="https://github.com/kaitlenw/ultimate-ttt">here</a>.
