            Hi! I'm Kaitlen, a fourth year undergraduate studying an integrated Masters degree (MEng) in Computer Science at the University of Warwick. My main interests are in web development and game development, but I'm always open to a challenge, and learning
            something new.

        <div id="about-me">
            <p>
                In my spare time, I train Pok&#233;mon; recently I became the Galar region Champion and even caught the fabled Zacian. In addition, I am a seasoned and competitive go-karter, and can often be found speeding down Rainbow Road. I'm also occasionally called
                upon to save the Kingdom of Hyrule from the grasps of the evil Ganon. In the past, I have travelled across land and even universe to save Princess Peach, and I'm currently searching for my brother in a haunted hotel with only a glorified
                vacuum cleaner to defend myself. Any enquiries and/or requests relating to this should be directed to my secretary,
                <a href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Isabelle">Isabelle</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not saving people and places from unrest, you can find me listening to or even playing music. I recently saw Bastille in concert and the West End musical <span class="titles">Waitress</span>, and I can also play the clarinet!
                <br />On rainy days, you may find me curled up with hot chocolate and a good book. I'm particularly interested in the people who played a part in the history of modern science (for example, I've read <span class="titles">Alan Turing: The Enigma</span>                by Andrew Hodges and <span class="titles">Hidden Figures</span> by Margot Lee Shetterly), however I also enjoy fictional adventures including classics such as <span class="titles">Sherlock Holmes</span>; in particular, I'm reading
                <span class="titles">War and Peace</span> by Leo Tolstoy. I also enjoy more modern writing such as <span class="titles">Angels and Demons</span> by Dan Brown or <span class="titles">The Priory of the Orange Tree</span> by Samantha Shannon.
